# ProjectShipInvader
The game is played in first-person, and with either mouse/keyboard or gamepad. Later in the game you get magnetic boots, which brings you the ability to wall-jump. There are 7 types of weapons (Shotgun/Pistol/SMG/Rocket/Minigun/Laser/Impulse), some of them have Upgrades, which make them e. g. faster (for the Rocketlauncher) but inaccurate.

## Story
The Aliens are invading the planet, but they did not succeed, now Planet Earth wants revenge. The Government sends the best of the best to exterminate the remaining Aliens. Your Objective is it to capture the ships, destroy the hives of the aliens. You progress through the story by destroying the hives and ramming into the ships of the aliens. Some Ships are the transports of high ranked, alien commanders, which are tough to beat but have a cool and nifty weapon. After crashing around, you finally arrive at the final ship of the whole fleet.

## Beginning
If you want to work with this game, read yourself into the GlobalAttribute class because this class handles the Variables passed between objects, then take a look at the GameManager class, if you're finished with that then take a look at the Issues/new feature() they will come more.
